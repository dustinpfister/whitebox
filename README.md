## Whitebox

This is an idea for something that is a whole bunch of different games that is actually just one game that is configured in a whole bunch of different ways.

It involves just one or more simple white box sprites that move, and behave in different ways depending on how it is configured. The project is inspired my the [Magnavox Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey)
