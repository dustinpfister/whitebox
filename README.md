# Whitebox

This is an idea for something that is a whole bunch of different games that is actually just one game that is configured in a whole bunch of different ways.

It involves just one or more simple white box sprites that move, and behave in different ways depending on how it is configured. The project is inspired my the [Magnavox Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnavox_Odyssey)

## wb_main.js

This file will include the main phaser game state that is used to start a certain game mode.

## wb_gfx.js

This is used to make simple graphics for whitebox

## wb_control.js

this contains methods that are used in the update method of a game mode to set values that are then used in the game logic of the current mode.
